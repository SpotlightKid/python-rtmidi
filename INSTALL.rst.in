============
Installation
============

**python-rtmidi** uses the de-facto standard Python distutils and setuptools_
based installation mechanism. Since it is a Python C(++)-extension a C++
compiler and build environment as well as some system-dependent libraries are
needed. See "Requirements" below for details.


Installer (Windows only)
------------------------

An installer with a pre-compiled version for Windows with Windows MultiMedia
API support is available through PyPI for some Python versions. Download it
from python-rtmidi's `PyPI page`_ and start the installer by double-clicking.


From PyPI
---------

If you have all the dependencies, you should be able to install the package
with pip_ or ``easy_install`` (from setuptools_)::

    $ pip install --pre python-rtmidi

or, if you prefer ``easy_install``::

    $ easy_install python-rtmidi

This will download the source distribution, compile the extension and install
it in your active Python installation. Unless you want to change the Cython_
source file ``_rtmidi.pyx``, there is no need to have Cython installed.

.. note::
    Starting with pip version 1.4, the installer requires_ the ``--pre`` option
    for installing pre-release versions of packages. Since development of
    **python-rtmidi** is still in beta-stage and the version numbers of its
    releases reflect this, the ``--pre`` option is necessary for now.

**python-rtmidi** also works well with virtualenv_ and virtualenvwrapper_. If
you have both installed, creating an isolated environment for testing and using
**python-rtmidi** is as easy as::

    $ mkvirtualenv rtmidi
    (rtmidi)$ pip install --pre python-rtmidi

.. _requires: http://www.pip-installer.org/en/1.4/logic.html#pre-release-versions


From the Source Distribution
----------------------------

Of course, you can also download the source distribution package as a Zip
archive or tarball, extract it and install using the common ``distutils``
commands, e.g.::

    $ wget ${download_url}python-rtmidi-${version}.tar.gz
    $ tar -xzf python-rtmidi-${version}.tar.gz
    $ cd python-rtmidi-${version}
    $ python setup.py install


From Subversion
---------------

Lastly, you can check out the **python-rtmidi** source code from the Git
repository and then install it from your working copy. Since the repository
does not include the C++ module source code pre-compiled from the Cython
source, you'll also need to install Cython >= 0.17, either via pip or from its
Git repository. Using virtualenv/virtualenvwrapper is strongly recommended in
this scenario:

Make a virtual environment::

    $ mkvirtualenv rtmidi
    (rtmidi)$ cdvirtualenv

Install ``Cython`` from PyPI::

    (rtmidi)$ pip install Cython

or the Git repository::

    (rtmidi)$ git clone https://github.com/cython/cython.git
    (rtmidi)$ cd cython
    (rtmidi)$ python setup.py install
    (rtmidi)$ cd ..

Install **python-rtmidi**::

    (rtmidi)$ git clone ${repository}
    (rtmidi)$ cd python-rtmidi
    (rtmidi)$ python setup.py install


Requirements
============

Naturally, you'll need a C++ compiler and a build environment. See the
platform-specific hints below.

Only if you want to change the Cython source file ``_rtmidi.pyx`` or want to
recompile ``_rtmidi.cpp`` with a newer Cython version, you'll need to install
Cython >= 0.17. The ``_rtmidi.cpp`` file in the current source distribution
(version ${version}) is tagged with::

    ${cpp_info}

RtMidi (and therefore **python-rtmidi**) supports several low-level MIDI
libraries on different operating systems. Only one of the available options
needs to be present on the target system, but support for more than one can be
compiled in. The setup script will try to detect available libraries and should
use the appropriate compilations flags automatically.

    * Linux: ALSA, JACK
    * OS X: CoreMIDI, JACK
    * Windows: MultiMedia (MM), Windows Kernel Streaming

The ``osc2midi`` example, which is installed alongside **python-rtmidi**
additionally requires the pyliblo_ and PyYAML_ libraries. These additional
dependencies are only installed by the ``setup.py`` script, if you specify the
*extra* ``osc2midi``, e.g.::

    $ pip install "python-rtmidi[osc2midi]"


Linux
-----

For the C++ compiler and the pthread library install the ``build-essential``
package on debian-based systems.

Then you'll need Python development headers and libraries. On Linux, install
the ``python-dev`` package. If you use the official installers from python.org
you should already have these.

To get ALSA support, you must install development files for the ``libasound``
library (debian package: ``libasound-dev``). For JACK support, install the
``libjack`` development files (``libjack-dev`` or ``libjack-jackd2-dev``).


OS X
----

Install the latest Xcode or ``g++`` from MacPorts or homebrew (untested).
CoreMIDI support comes with installing Xcode. For JACK support, install `JACK
for OS X`_ with the full installer.

.. note::
    If you have a version of OS X and Xcode which still supports building
    binaries for PPC, you'll have to tell distribute to build the package only
    for i386 and x86_64 architectures::

        env ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64" python setup.py install


Windows
-------

On Windows you'll need Visual Studio 2008 (Express) to build **python-rtmidi**
for Python <= 3.2 or Visual Studio 2010 (Express) for Python 3.3 if you use the
official Python binary distributions for Windows.

Please see the detailed instructions for Windows in the file
``INSTALL-windows.rst``.

Bash on Windows
---------------
Using the latest insider preview of Windows adds a subsystem for Linux and users can use Bash just like a Linux shell. In order to set-up RtMidi,
there are a few additional setup steps.

* Setup the Pip and Python
    * `apt-get remove upstart`
    * `apt-get remove udev`
    * `apt-get autoremove`
    * `sudo apt-get install python-pip`
    * `sudo apt-get install python-dev`
    * `nano /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d`
    * Write in this file the following:

        #!/bin/sh
        exit 101

    * `chmod +x /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d`
    * `dpkg-divert --local --rename --add /sbin/initctl`
    * `ln -s /bin/true /sbin/initctl`            
* Setup RtMidi
    * `sudo apt-get download udev`
    * `sudo apt-get install initramfs-tools` 
    * `sudo dpkg -i --force-all confmiss udev_*.deb
    * `apt-get install -y alsa-utils`
    * `gpasswd -a root audio`

Unfortunately, there are some issues around the current version of Bash on Windows which prevents the Alsa and soundcards from being accessible.
(Try running `alsamixer` and `aplay -l` to see if it works on your device)
The issue is here: https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/237

Still, RtMidi can be installed and is technically accessible through Python.
