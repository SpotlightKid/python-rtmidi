## 1.4.2 (2020-07-18)

Enhancements:

-   Added more helpful aliases for MIDI events/controllers constants.

Examples:

-   Added `ccstore` advanced example to show how to remember last seen
    controller change values (#64).


## 1.4.1 (2020-04-16)

Changes:

-   Suppress RtMidi warnings to stderr, so that warnings issued in
    the constructor of the `RtMidiIn/Out` C++ class instances before
    the default error handler function can be attached, don't end
    up in the output.

    The suppression of RtMidi warnings can be disabled at compile time by
    setting the pre-compiler define `__RTMIDI_SUPPRESS_WARNINGS__` via a
    command line option to `setup.py`.

    As before, RtMidi warnings are turned into Python a `UserWarning` as soon
    as the default error handler is attached, but this can only happen after
    the RtMidi C++ class has been instantiated (#59).

-   Allow deletion of internal C++ RtMidiIn/Out instance via new `delete`
    method of `rtmidi.MidiIn` and `rtmidi.MidiOut` instances (but see warning
    in docstring!). Also added a `is_deleted` property to both classes (#60).


## 1.4.0 (2020-01-19)

Changes:

-   Dropped nominal Python 2 support (no code changes or removals
    related to this, though).
-   Dropped Python 3.4 support.
-   Added Python 3.8 to `setup.py` classifier.

Enhancements:

-   Added `MODULATION` as an alias for `MODULATION_WHEEL` to
    `rtmidi.midiconstants`.

Examples:

-   Added `midiclock` example to show how to receive MIDI timing clock (#48).
-   Changed `midioutwrapper` example to use `rtmidi.midiutil.open_midiout` so
    that it also works on Windows (with no virtual ports support) (#51).

Documentation:

-   Added note about `pip` being called `pip3` on Debian-based systems to
    install instructions (#49).
-   Documented context manager protocol support better (#52).
-   Clarified purpose of `data` argument of `MidiIn.set_callback` (#55).
-   Updated year in copyright info in license file and Sphinx documentation.


Project infrastructure:

-   Removed Python 2.7 from CI tests and package builds.
-   Added Python 3.8 to CI and package builds.


## 1.3.1 (2019-10-15)

Enhancements / Changes:

-   RtMidi C++ exceptions are now caught when creating `RtMidiIn/Out` instances
    and converted into a Python `rtmidi.SystemError` exception.
-   Helper functions in `rtmidi.midiutil` now raise sub-classes of
    `rtmidi.RtMidiError` wherever appropriate. The docstrings were updated
    accordingly.
-   Updated `rtmidi` sub-module, which includes the following changes:
    -   C++ exceptions, when thrown, do not print the error message to stderr
        anymore.
    -   When the JACK backend can't be initialized (e.g. when the server isn't
        running) it causes a `DRIVER_ERROR` instead of just a printing a
        `WARNING`.

Examples:

-   `midiout.py`: removed surplus second argument to `open_midioutput` left
    over from previous version of script.
-   Renamed example script `midiwrapper.py` to `midioutwrapper.py` to better
    indicate its function.
-   `sendsysex.py`: use helper functions from midiutil module to list and open
    MIDI ports; improve error handling.
-   Made sure MIDI ports are always properly closed and `MidiIn/Out` instances
    are deleted.
-   Inserted delay before closing/deleting output (may be needed with Windows
    MMS).
-   Simplified command line argument handling.
-   Fixed example script file names in header comments.

Documentation:

-   Made various small documentation wording changes and typo fixes.
-   Updated year in copyright info in license file and Sphinx documentation.

Project infrastructure:

-   Updated development dependency on `urllib3` to 1.24.2 (CVE-2019-11324).


## 1.3.0 (2019-04-15)

    commit 791dfea.

Documentation:

-   Improved installation instructions and listed options recognized by
    `setup.py`.


## 1.2.1 (2019-01-18)

Fixes:

-   Fixed build when compiling with JACK support, but JACK version is too old
    to have `jack_port_rename` function (#40).

Project infrastructure:

-   Added Linux builds for Python 2.7 and 3.4 - 3.7 to Travis CI setup.


## 1.2.0 (2019-01-13)

Project infrastructure:

-   RtMidi Sources and header are now included as a git sub-module from the
    'python-rtmidi' branch of a [fork] of the upstream RtMidi repository. This
    fork incorporates changes and fixes by pull requests to the upstream
    repository, which are (yet) unmerged, and some changes specific to
    python-rtmidi.

[fork]: https://github.com/SpotlightKid/rtmidi

Enhancements / Changes:

-   Added `get_rtmidi_version` module-level function.
-   Added `set_client_name` and `set_port_name` methods to `MidiIn`'s and
    `MidiOut`'s base class.
-   Added a bunch of new custom exceptions, all derived from `RtMidiError`.
-   A default error handler callback is now set for `MidiIn` and`MidiOut`
    instances, which maps C++ level errors into custom Python exceptions.

Examples:

-   Enhanced example script `midiwrapper.py` with methods for more MIDI
    messages, including sending all kinds of controller change and of
    (N)RPN messages.

Fixes:

-   Fixed SysEx message reception in JACK backend in RtMidi: messages broken up
    over several events are now collected into a single event before being
    passed to the input callback or returned by `MidiIn.get_message`.
-   Fixed missing MIDI message input filtering in JACK backend in RtMidi:
    `MidiIn.ignoreTypes` now works as intended.

Testing:

-   Restructured tests in `test_rtmidi` and added tests for new methods.


## 1.1.2 (2018-10-10)

    to PyPI when a new release tag is pushed to GitHub.

    Thanks to Benoit Pierre for the PR (#36).

-   Upload Gzip\'ed instead Bzip\'ed tarballs for source distributions to PyPI.

-   `python setup.py test` now runs `tox`, so `tests_require` in `setup.py` is
    empty now. We want dependencies to be only handled by `pip`, never by
    `setuptools`.

Documentation:

-   Minor additions, updates, fixes and wording tweaks.


## 1.1.1 (2018-08-06)

Building:

-   Applied patch from <https://github.com/thestk/rtmidi/pull/89>.
    This means that when using the ALSA API port names are reported
    in the form `<client name>:<port name> <port id>` (this change
    was actually already in version 1.0.0).
-   Added new `MidiIn` / `MidiOut` method `is_port_open`.
-   `MidiIn` / `MidiOut` constructors and `open_port` / `open_virtual_port`
    methods now raise `TypeError` when an invalid type is passed as the
    client resp. port name.

        `open_midiport`.
    -   Added convenience functions `open_midiinput` and
        `open_midioutput`, which wrap `open_midiport`.
    -   RtMidi API to use can be specified via the `RTMIDI_API`
        environment variable. Only used when `API_UNSPECIFIED` is
        passed for the `api` argument. Value should be one of the
        `API_*` constant names with out the `API_` prefix, e.g.
        `UNIX_JACK` for the Jack API.

## 0.5b1 (2014-06-11)

Fixes:

-   Synced [RtMidi] code with git repo @ 2c7a6664d6, which fixed
    several issues (see
    <https://github.com/thestk/rtmidi/issues?state=closed>).
-   `MidiIn/Out.open_virtual_port` returns `self` for context
    manager support, consistent with `MidiIn/Out.open_port`.
-   Fix Python \<= 2.6 incompatible encode method call
    (python-rtmidi officially only supports Python \>= 2.7). Thanks
    to Michiel Overtoom for reporting this.
-   Respect passed MIDI api when requesting MidiOut instance from
    `midiutil.open_midiport`.

Enhancements / Changes:

-   Support for Windows Kernel Streaming API was removed in RtMidi
    (it was broken anyway) and consequently in `python-rtmidi` as
    well.
-   Raise `RtMidiError` exception when trying to open a (virtual)
    port on a `MidiIn/Out` instance that already has an open
    (virtual) port.

    commands on reception of configurable MIDI events, with example
    configuration.
-   New example directory `drumseq` with a simple drum pattern
    sequencer and example drum patterns. Thanks to Michiel Overtoom
    for the original script!

-   Add `api` parameter to `midiutil.open_midiport` function to
    select backend API.
-   Make client name for `MidiOut` and `MidiIn` different again,
    because some backend APIs might require unique client names.

-   `midiutils.open_midiport`:
    -   Allow to pass (substring of) port name as alternative to
        port number.
    -   Re-raise `EOFError` and `KeyboardInterrupt` instead of using
        `sys.exit()`.
