"""A Python wrapper for the RtMidi C++ library written with Cython.


Overview
========

RtMidi_ is a set of C++ classes which provides a concise and simple,
cross-platform API (Application Programming Interface) for realtime MIDI
input/output across Linux (ALSA & JACK), Macintosh OS X (CoreMidi & JACK),
and Windows (Multimedia Library & Kernel Streaming) operating systems.

python-rtmidi_ is a Python binding for RtMidi implemented with Cython_ and
provides a thin wrapper around the RtMidi C++ interface. The API is basically
the same as the C++ one but with the naming scheme of classes, methods and
parameters adapted to the Python PEP-8 conventions and requirements of
the Python package naming structure. ``python-rtmidi`` supports Python 2
(tested with Python 2.7) and Python 3 (3.2).

.. note::
    ``python-rtmidi`` is currently in **alpha-stage**, which means is is
    published in the hope that other developers try it out and help finding
    bugs, and that its API is not yet finalised. What is there should work
    but is currently only tested thoroughly under Linux/ALSA and less regularly
    under Linux/JACK and OS X CoreMIDI and JACK. Windows support is still
    untested but will be reviewed soon.


Usage example
-------------

Here's a quick example of how to use ``python-rtmidi`` to open the first
available MIDI output port and send a middle C note on MIDI channel 10::

    import time
    import rtmidi

    midiout = rtmidi.MidiOut()
    available_ports = midiout.get_ports()

    if available_ports:
        midiout.open_port(0)
    else:
        midiout.open_virtual_port("My virtual output")

    note_on = [0x99, 60, 112] # channel 10, middle C, velocity 112
    note_off = [0x89, 60, 0]
    midiout.send_message(note_on)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    midiout.send_message(note_off)

    del midiout

More usage examples can be found in the ``tests`` directory of the source
distribution. API documentation is available by looking at the docstrings in
the Cython source code or using tools like ``pydoc`` or IPython_ and by
reading the RtMidi_ documentation.


Installation
============

``python-rtmidi`` is a Python C(++)-extension and therefore a C++ compiler
and a build environment as well as some system-dependant libraries are needed.
See "Requirements" below for details.


From PyPI
---------

If you have all the dependencies, you should be able to install the package
with pip_ or ``easy_install``::

    $ pip install python-rtmidi

or, if you prefer setuptools_::

    $ easy_install python-rtmidi

This will download the source distribution, compile the extension and install
it in your active Python installation. Unless you want to change the Cython
source file ``rtmidi.pyx``, there is no need to have Cython installed.

``python-rtmidi`` also works well with virtualenv_ and virtualenvwrapper_. If
you have both installed, creating an isolated environment for testing and using
``python-rtmidi`` is as easy as::

    $ mkvirtualenv rtmidi
    (rtmidi)$ pip install python-rtmidi


From the Source Distribution
----------------------------

Of course, you can also download the source distribution package as a Zip
archive or tarball, extract it and install using the common ``distutils``
commands, e.g.::

    $ wget %(download_url)spython-rtmidi-%(version)s.tar.gz
    $ tar xzf python-rtmidi-%(version)s.tar.gz
    $ cd python-rtmidi-%(version)s
    $ python setup.py install


From Subversion
---------------

Lastly, you can check out the ``python-rtmidi`` source code from the
Subversion repository and then install it from your working copy. Since the
repository does not include the C++ module source code pre-compiled from the
Cython source, you'll also need to install Cython from its Git repository.
Using virtualenv/virtualenvwrapper is strongly recommended in this scenario::

    $ mkvirtualenv rtmidi
    (rtmidi)$ cdvirtualenv
    (rtmidi)$ git clone https://github.com/cython/cython.git
    (rtmidi)$ svn co svn://svn.chrisarndt.de/projects/python-rtmidi/trunk python-rtmidi
    (rtmidi)$ cd cython
    (rtmidi)$ python setup.py install
    (rtmidi)$ cd ../python-rtmidi
    (rtmidi)$ python setup.py install


Requirements
============

Naturally, you'll need a C++ compiler and a build environment. On debian-based
Linux systems, installing the ``build-essential`` package should get you this,
on Mac OS X install the latest Xcode or ``g++`` from MacPorts or homebrew. On
Windows you can use MinGW.

Then you'll need Python development headers and libraries. On Linux, install
the ``python-dev`` package. If you use the official installers from python.org
you should already have these.

Only if you want to change the Cython source file ``rtmidi.pyx`` or want to
recompile ``rtmidi.cpp`` with a newer Cython version, you'll need to install
Cython >= 0.17. Currently this version is only available via the Git
respository (see Cython web site) as version 0.17pre. The ``rtmidi.cpp`` file
in the  source distribution was compiled with Cython 0.17pre as of 2012-07-13.

RtMidi (and therefore ``python-rtmidi``) supports several low-level MIDI
libraries on different operating systems. Only one of the available options
needs to be present on the target system, but support for more than one can be
compiled in.

    * Linux: ALSA, JACK
    * OS X: CoreMIDI, JACK
    * Windows: MultiMedia (MM), Windows Kernel Streaming

On Linux, to get ALSA support, you must install development files for the
``libasound`` library (debian package: ``libasound-dev``). For JACK support,
install the ``libjack`` development files (``libjack-dev`` or
``libjack-jackd2-dev``).

On OS X, CoreMIDI support comes with installing Xcode. For JACK support,
install JACK for OS X from http://www.jackosx.com/ with the full installer.

On Windows, for Windows MultiMedia System support you'll need ``WinM.Lib`` from
the Microsoft `Platform SDK`_ or the Windows SDK, which superceded the Platform
SDK for more recent Windows versions. After you have installed the SDK, you may
need to edit the ``WINLIB_DIR`` variable at the top of the ``setup.py`` file to
point to the location of ``WinMM.lib``. Support for compiling ``python-rtmidi``
with Windows Kernel Streaming support in the setup file is currently untested.
If you try it, please let the author know of your experiences.
