"""A Python wrapper for the RtMidi C++ library written with Cython.


Overview
========

RtMidi_ is a set of C++ classes which provides a concise and simple,
cross-platform API (Application Programming Interface) for realtime MIDI
input/output across Linux (ALSA & JACK), Macintosh OS X (CoreMIDI & JACK),
and Windows (MultiMedia Library) operating systems.

python-rtmidi_ is a Python binding for RtMidi implemented with Cython_ and
provides a thin wrapper around the RtMidi C++ interface. The API is basically
the same as the C++ one but with the naming scheme of classes, methods and
parameters adapted to the Python PEP-8 conventions and requirements of
the Python package naming structure. **python-rtmidi** supports Python 2
(tested with Python 2.7) and Python 3 (3.2, 3.3).

.. note::
    **python-rtmidi** is currently in **beta-stage**, which means it is
    published in the hope that other developers try it out and help finding
    bugs, and that its API is not yet finalised. What is there should work
    but is currently only tested thoroughly under Linux ALSA/JACK and less
    regularly under OS X (CoreMIDI/JACK) and Windows (WinMM).


Usage example
-------------

Here's a quick example of how to use **python-rtmidi** to open the first
available MIDI output port and send a middle C note on MIDI channel 1::

    import time
    import rtmidi

    midiout = rtmidi.MidiOut()
    available_ports = midiout.get_ports()

    if available_ports:
        midiout.open_port(0)
    else:
        midiout.open_virtual_port("My virtual output")

    note_on = [0x90, 60, 112] # channel 1, middle C, velocity 112
    note_off = [0x80, 60, 0]
    midiout.send_message(note_on)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    midiout.send_message(note_off)

    del midiout

More usage examples can be found in the ``tests`` and ``examples`` directory
of the source distribution. API documentation is available by looking at the
docstrings in the Cython source code ``src/_rtmidi.pyx`` or using tools like
``pydoc`` or IPython_ and by reading the (somewhat terse and inaccurate)
RtMidi_ documentation.
